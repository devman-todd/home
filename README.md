<h2> ⚡ Fun fact:</h2>

Before diving into cybersecurity, I spent years training clients in different gyms, all while using technology to run my fitness business efficiently. So at one point, I switched my major from nutrition to cybersecurity and haven't looked back since! From sweating it out with sets to securing IT assets, I'm all about flexing both my physical and digital muscles. (Thanks ChatGPT for that corny line 😅)
